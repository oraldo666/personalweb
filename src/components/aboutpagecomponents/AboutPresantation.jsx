        I started learning python programming in 2021 and web developing was the
        field i wanted to explore. The first framework i learned was{" "}
        <b>Django</b> which is a high-level Python web framework that encourages
        rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

      <p className="about-other-paragraphs">
        Using only Django Framework made me wanting to learn more about
        front-end technologies, so i started learning javascript and{" "}
        <b>React Js</b>, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces which
        made the development of the web application realy easier.
